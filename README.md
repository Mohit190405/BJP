## Project Description

This project is a collection of simple Java programs that serve as a starting point for beginners to learn Java programming. The programs cover the following topics:

1. **Variables and Data Types**: Demonstrates how to declare and initialize variables of different data types.
2. **Arithmetic Operations**: Performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) on two numbers.
3. **Conditionals**: Checks if a number is positive, negative, or zero using if-else statements.
4. **Loops**: Prints numbers from 1 to 10 using for, while, and do-while loops.
5. **Arrays**: Declares, initializes, and prints elements of an array.
6. **Methods**: Creates a method that takes two integers as parameters and returns their sum.
7. **String Operations**: Concatenates two strings, finds the length of a string, and converts a string to uppercase.

## Installation

To run these Java programs, you need to have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine. Follow these steps to set up your environment:

1. **Install JDK**:
   - Download and install the latest version of JDK from the [Oracle website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html) or use an open-source alternative like [OpenJDK](https://openjdk.java.net/).

2. **Set Up Environment Variables**:
   - Set the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable to the path of your JDK installation.
   - Add the `bin` directory of the JDK to your system's `PATH` variable.

3. **Verify Installation**:
   - Open a terminal or command prompt and run the following commands to verify the installation:
     ```sh
     java -version
     javac -version
     ```

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepository.git
   cd yourrepository
